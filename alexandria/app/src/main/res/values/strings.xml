    <string name="sample_text">Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination.\n\nSet on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad\'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble familyâ€”and would bring to fruition humankind\'s most ancient and unattainable dream.\n\nA stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what it undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.</string>
